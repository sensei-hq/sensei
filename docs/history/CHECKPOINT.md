# Checkpoint

**State 2026-10-14.** v0.13.0 shipped (the dōjō takes the person's session
only; production 401s a device token). History scrub done. Working the queue
on `develop` (`426ea426`), toward 0.14.0.

| increment | status |
|---|---|
| History scrub: transcript review + 5 contributor names out of all history | DONE — force-pushed develop/main/6 tags; PR refs need GitHub Support purge |
| #266 session retrospective as an independent capability | FILED (later) |
| #241 org-home needs band = triage queue; health alerts "not measured" | DONE `da9b5419` (sparkline/needs/billing wait on sources) |
| #252 a team sees THAT a run is going (status only) | DONE `6176afd0` |
| #240 provable user-scoped metrics reach the dōjō | DONE `79f14390`, `6cd03d62` |
| #245 app e2e gate | PARTIAL `42bcca43`…`426ea426` — atlas, diagrams, dojo-binding, scan, knowledge-sources, db-setup, multi-window, project-window-depth, a11y, setup-wizard green; left: #267, Instruments call |

**Next command:** `gh issue view 267` (e2e must not touch the real `~/.claude`),
then #225, #238, #254.

**Open questions (user's):**
- Discovered-MCP-servers section and per-server toggle were dropped in the
  Instruments redesign — restore, or retire their two e2e tests?
- `deploy-dojo` for 0.13.0 awaits approval; the `device_token_hash` drop needs an
  attended `dbd reconcile --scope dojo --allow-destructive`.
- Stray Cloudflare build config `1ad95662…` (trigger "develop") still fails the
  "Workers Builds: dojo" check — delete it in the dashboard.
- Sign in under Settings → Dōjō on this machine: nothing syncs until then (#184).

**Known-broken:** e2e: assistants dev-hook (#267), 2 Instruments tests (#245); 0.14.0 needs `deploy-dojo` before
the Worker can file metrics (`dojo.file_metric_rows`).

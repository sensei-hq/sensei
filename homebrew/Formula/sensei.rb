# Homebrew formula for the Sensei CLI tools.
# Installs: senseid (daemon), sensei (CLI), sensei-mcp (MCP server)
#
# Two install paths:
#   brew install sensei-hq/tap/sensei          # released artefacts (default)
#   brew install --HEAD sensei-hq/tap/sensei   # build from main branch source
#
# The HEAD path is the fallback when no release has been tagged yet (404 on
# the tarball URL). Build invocation goes through `make crates-release` so
# the formula and `make install-release` share one cargo invocation.

      Installed sensei binaries (port 7744, db sensei, dir ~/.sensei/).

      Start the daemon:

        brew services start sensei   # managed by launchd, restarts on crash
        # or, for a foreground process:
        sensei start

      Configure sensei for your AI coding platform:

        sensei install --acp claude-code   # or cursor, windsurf
        sensei scan ~/Developer            # scan and index your repos

      Before uninstalling:

        sensei stop
        sensei uninstall

      Note: Homebrew formulas have no uninstall hook, so this step is manual.

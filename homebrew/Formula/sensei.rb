# Homebrew formula for the Sensei CLI tools.
# Installs: senseid (daemon), sensei (CLI), sensei-mcp (MCP server)
#
# Two install paths:
#   brew install sensei-hq/tap/sensei          # released artefacts (default)
#   brew install --HEAD sensei-hq/tap/sensei   # build from main branch source
#
# The HEAD path mirrors the sensei-dev formula's behaviour — useful when no
# release has been tagged yet (404 on the tarball URL). Build invocation goes
# through `make crates-release` so the formula and `make install-release`
# share one cargo invocation.

      Installed sensei prod binaries (port 7744, db sensei, dir ~/.sensei/).

      Start the prod daemon:

        brew services start sensei   # managed by launchd, restarts on crash
        # or, for a foreground process:
        sensei start

      Configure sensei for your AI coding platform:

        sensei install --acp claude-code   # or cursor, windsurf
        sensei scan ~/Developer            # scan and index your repos

      The prod binaries coexist with the sensei-dev formula — both can be
      installed on the same machine and registered with Claude Code under
      distinct MCP keys (`sensei` and `sensei-dev`).

      Before uninstalling:

        sensei stop
        sensei uninstall

      Note: Homebrew formulas have no uninstall hook, so this step is manual.
